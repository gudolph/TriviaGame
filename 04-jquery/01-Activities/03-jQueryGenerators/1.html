    // Thanks to jQuery's handy $ selector ... we have a wealth of new methods for selecting and manipulating HTML.

    // Here we are using jQuery's .HTML method to instantly select and change the contents of our empty-div. $ is how you grab in jQuery
    //.html is doing the same as createElement, but now you have to put the whole element in, tags and all.
    $("#empty-div").html("<h1>Hello friends!</h1>");

    // We can just as easily append a new line using a similarly simple .append method, which is like appendChild
    $("#empty-div").append("A pleasure to meet you!");
