        <p>Growing up I was always on the move. Literally. My dad was in the Army and after being born in San Francisco
            I moved with my family across the US and Europe. Finally he retired from the service and started a practice
            in Grand Junction, Colorado where I finished high school with the great High Rockies at my backdoor.</p>
        <p>After graduating I came to Utah and met my wife while doing theatre at Westminster College, a hobby that
            we've both enjoyed for many years since. I finished up a Philosophy degree and then a Biology BS at the U
            in hopes of doing something in the medical field. After a lot of consideration I decided that being a
            developer would make for a satisfying and fulfilling career I could sink my teeth into. Now I spend my free
            time playing piano, singing in choirs with my wife when we have a chance, and taking my dogs on hikes.</p>
